    <h2>Thank you next</h2>
    
    <ul> 
    Thought I'd end up with Sean
    But he wasn't a match<br>
    Wrote some songs about Ricky<br>
    Now I listen and laugh<br>
    Even almost got married<br>
    And for Pete, I'm so thankful<br>
    Wish I could say "thank you" to Malcolm<br>
    'Cause he was an angel<br>
    One taught me love<br>
    One taught me patience<br>
    And one taught me pain<br>
    Now, I'm so amazing<br>
    Say I've loved and I've lost<br>
    But that's not what I see<br>
    So, look what I got<br>
    Look at what you taught me<br>

    Holding hands with my mama<br>
    I'll be thanking my dad<br>
